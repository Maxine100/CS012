/* 9.15 PROGRAM 2: Classes (Date)
Collaboration Policy Reminder
You may not use code from any source (another student, a book, online, etc.) within your solution to this PROGRAM. In fact, you may not even look at another student's solution or partial solution to this PROGRAM. You also may not allow another student to look at any part of your solution to this exercise. You should get help on this assignment by coming to the instructor's or TA's office hours or by posting questions on Piazza (you still must not post assignment code publicly on Piazza.)

Problem Definition
Build a Date class and a main function to test it.

Specifications
Below is the interface for the Date class: it is our "contract" with you: you have to implement everything it describes. The comments in the interface below should be sufficient for you to understand the project (use these comments in your Date declaration), without the need of any further documentation. But of course, as always, you can ask us any questions you may have on Piazza.


Note: Placing the error messages into the constructors like is not necessarily a good way to handle constructor errors, but until you learn about exceptions in CS 14, it's the best we can do.

Private Member Functions
The functions declared private above, isLeap, daysPerMonth, name, number, are helper functions - member functions that will never be needed by a user of the class, and so do not belong to the public interface (which is why they are "private"). They are, however, needed by the interface functions (public member functions), which use them to test the validity of arguments and construct valid dates. For example, the constructor that passes in the month as a string will call the number function to assign a value to the unsigned member variable month.

isLeap: The rule for whether a year is a leap year is:

(year % 4 == 0) implies leap year
except (year % 100 == 0) implies NOT leap year
except (year % 400 == 0) implies leap year
So, for instance, year 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is NOT a leap year. Years 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, etc. are all leap years. Years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, etc. are NOT leap years.

Output Specifications
Read the specifications for the print function carefully. The only cout statements within your Date member functions should be:

the "Invalid Date" warnings in the constructors
in your two print functions

Required Main Function
You must use this main function and global function getDate as they are here. You may not change these functions at all. Copy-and-paste these into your main.cpp file and then add the Date class. */

		Date();


		/* parameterized constructor: month number, day year
		   - e.g. (3, 1, 2010) will construct the date March 1st, 2010
		
		   If any of the arguments are invalid (e.g. 15 for month or 32 for day)
		   then the constructor will construct instead a valid Date as close
		   as possible to the arguments provided - e.g. in above example,
		   Date(15, 32, 2010), the Data would be corrected to Dec 31st, 2010.
		   In case of such invalid input, the constructor will issue a console error massage:

		   Invalid date values: Data corrected to 12/31/2010.
		   (with a newline at the end).
		*/
		Date(unsigned m, unsigned d, unsigned y);

		/* parameterized constructor: month name, day, year
		    - e.g. (December, 15, 2012) will construct the date December 15th, 2012

		    If the constructor is unable to recognize the string argument as a valid month name,
		    then it will issue a console error message:
		
		    Invalid month name: the Date was set to 1/1/2000.
		    (with a newline at the end).
		
		    If the day argument is invalid for the given month (but the month name was valid),
		    then the constructor will handle this error in the same manner as the other
		    parameterized constructor.

		    This constructor will recognize both "december" and "December"
		    as month name.
